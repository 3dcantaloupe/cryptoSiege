Diamond Hacks 2024 Project

A simulation in which the red team tries to break into the blue team's network, by breaking forms of encryption such as finding a key, figuring out info about the ciphertext, basically man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The blue team then patches the vulnerabilities and tries to defend against the red team's attacks.
